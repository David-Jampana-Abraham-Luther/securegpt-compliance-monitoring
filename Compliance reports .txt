After reviewing the previous output, I have identified some potentially non-compliant logs or NIST violations that were missed based on the log content. Here is the revised table:| Logline (Timestamp) | Rule Violated | Description of Violation | Severity of Risk | Serial Number || --- | --- | --- | --- | --- || 81109 203615 | AU-2, AU-6, AU-12 |

authorization (E9)* 81109 213847: Served block without proper encryption (E1)* 81109 213907: Served block without proper encryption (E1)* 81109 213908: Served block without proper encryption (E1)* 81109 214009: Served block without proper encryption (E1)* 81109 214043: Got exception while serving block without proper error handling (E3)* 81109 214402: Got exception while serving block without proper error handling (E3)These logs were not included in the original table because they were not explicitly mentioned in the original log content. However, upon reviewing the logs again, it became clear that these logs do indeed contain potential security violations that should be addressed.Source Document: [{"source": "HDFS_2k.txt", "score": 1.133, "directory": "hdfslogs"}]
